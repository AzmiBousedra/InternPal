## 💡 The Problem
The internship hunt is a numbers game that quickly becomes a full-time job. Manually searching portals, tailoring cover letters, and re-entering the same data for hundreds of applications is inefficient and error-prone. I wanted to engineer a solution to handle the repetitive heavy lifting so I could focus on interview prep and building my actual skills.

## 🚀 The Solution: Intern Pal v1.0
This is a modular CLI tool that automates the key stages of the application process. It can be run step-by-step or in a "Full Auto-Pilot" mode that chains all scripts together for an end-to-end, hands-free experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** TypeScript, Node.js
* **Browser Automation & Scraping:** Playwright
* **AI & NLP:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API
* **Document Processing:** Docxtemplater, PizZip, LibreOffice-Convert
* **CLI UI/UX:** @inquirer/prompts, Chalk, Figlet, Gradient-String
